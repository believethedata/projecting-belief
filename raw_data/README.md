# Raw data sources
There were two main sources of data behind the projections:
 1. Census data on religion by sex and age
 2. ONS population forecasts

The ONS population forecasts are provided centrally for all countries. They are described [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections/datasets/2014basednationalpopulationprojectionstableofcontents). For convenience, direct links to the zip files for each country are provided below:

 - [Northern Ireland](https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections/datasets/z6zippedpopulationprojectionsdatafilesnorthernireland/2022based/ni.zip)

 The census files used for each country are described in `README.md` files in the respective directories.
