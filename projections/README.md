# Projection methodology
The overall projection model has two components:
 1. a population projection which projects population by Local District Authority (LDA), sex and age band
 2. a religious mix (percentage) projection which projects the mix at the same level of granularity

Both models make projections for every year between 2022 and 2031 inclusive.

These two projections need to be run before the third step, which combines them to project the population by year, religion, LDA, sex and age band.

More details on each step can be found in `README.md` files in the respective folders.
