# Religious mix projection model
Religious mix is projected forward separately for populations who were alive in 2021 (and therefore show up in that census) and those who weren't. These are labelled by the age they will be at the next census in 2031 - over-ten and under-ten respectively:
 - The model for over-tens is a weighted ensemble of extrapolation-based models
 - the model for under-tens relates the religious mix of newborns in an area to a parental-age group in the same area, selected as being the most predictive when tested on historical data
 
Both of these models are explained in more detail in the `model_selection` folder.
